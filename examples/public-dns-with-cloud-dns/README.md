# Deploy a W&B with a domain that uses GCP Cloud DNS as the DNS service

## About

This example is a minimal example of what is needed to deploy an instance of
Weights & Biases that uses a Domain hosted in Route53.

## Module Prerequisites

As with the main version of this module, this example assumes the following
resources already exist:

- A valid Cloud DNS for the provided domain
- Valid W&B Local license (You get one at [here](https://deploy.wandb.ai))

### Setting up Terraform

- TODO: How to download terraform?
- The required version of terraform for this module is v1.1.7 or greater

### Setting up a google domain

### Setting up a google sub-domain

### Getting a W&B license

### Getting the ID of a project in GCP

### Setting the region and zone in GCP

### Setting the stage

- First authorize your google account by running the command `gcloud auth login`

  - This would take you to the browser to select the google account to authenticate with GCP
  - Once the google account is selected and authorized, you should see a message similar to:

    ```markdown
    You are now logged in as [venkata@wandb.com].
    Your current project is [playground-111]. You can change this setting by running:
    $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

    Updates are available for some Cloud SDK components. To install them,
    please run:
    $ gcloud components update

    To take a quick anonymous survey, run:
    $ gcloud survey
    ```

- Clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-google-wandb) to get access to the W&Bâ€™s google terraform module
- As a next step, navigate to the examples directory in the [terraform-google-wandb](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-google-wandb/tree/main/examples) repo
  - Then, `cd public-dns-with-cloud-dns`
- Now, create a file called `terraform.tfvars` under the current directory
- `terraform.tfvars` should have the following variables included,
  ```markdown
  project_id = "<id-of-the-project-in-gcp>"
  region = "<gcp-region-to-deploy>"
  zone = "<gcp-zone-to-deploy>"
  namespace = "<unique-name-for-the-namespace>"
  license = "<W&B-license-key>"
  subdomain = "<subdomain-for-accessing-the-UI>"
  domain = "<domain-for-accessing-the-UI>"
  ```
  Note that, `subdomain` and `domain` are optional fields. If you do not create a domain and subdomain, W&B automatically provisions one for you at `wandb.io`
  An example `terraform.tfvars` file would look like this,
  ```markdown
  project_id = "playground-111"
  region = "us-west4"
  zone = "us-west4-a"
  namespace = "venky-unique-3"
  license = "eyJhbGciOiJS6InUzhEUXM1M0xQY09yNnZhaTdoSlduYnF1bTRZTlZWd1VwSWM9In0.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.O_6D3Av9QoWI16ybg54KFvs7eGWugSXPxmfhobtZe3TBFvd8PwmSCAmMojmKWsqg6KNjLJ9sjxOP_3Pj9OAdrkx5WzU0KTcIByXD2hS9VwyYUOYEohBn65oCLnQJLYphXJBrB9JVS0GSUGxR1AzwnUK1PuKZ6jQFrpt-feQOD3rvCdyM1eBQ73rdHk6zfEBmdiZ7C4LiRLV8OEMxUfwxASvVF_cFUEeVQx82AaxRwfPBLZxXTL4qlQOIFjAKwGVyDMEWq04BhQ_ASdyND45w5qXiUOlvFOergrFyGBSHg-9yDT4fhdkDw5puGthDaMFsn02rr0eYHuxKFWSY958aig"
  subdomain = "venky"
  domain = "wandb.ml"
  ```

### Initializing the terraform

- First step is to initialize the terraform module in the current directory, you can do that by running

```markdown
terraform init
```

This initializes all the required modules to successfully deploy the W&B infrastructure

- If you are running into an error like `Error: Failed to query available provider packages` just run the following command:

```markdown
terraform init -upgrade
```

This makes sure all the terraform initialization version requirements are satisfied by downloading the latest terraform module versions

### Running the terraform

- Once the terraform is initialized and you have all the values set in the `terraform.tfvars` , you should be able to apply the terraform by running the following command:

```markdown
terraform apply
```

- This will output a plan of all the resources to be created by terraform in your GCP account
- The terminal prompts to enter `yes`, if you intend to continue
- Once you input `yes` the terraform creation process begins
